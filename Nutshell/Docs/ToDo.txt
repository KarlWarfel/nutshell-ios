Various To Do Notes

Basic frame out of application:
    - Import login flow and tests from Urchin
    - Do a UITest to see how Xcode now supports this -> looks like KIF might be a better option
    - Try using PaintCode's StyleKit for some graphics, colors, etc.

Splash screen:
    - Need a background png for this, different sizes.

Questions:
- How is log-in flow spliced in? Just replace window?
