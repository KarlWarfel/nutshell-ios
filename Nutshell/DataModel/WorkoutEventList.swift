    This part of the data model should provide:

    - A current list of workout events from other local applications fetched via Healthkit. Note that workout events consist of single workout items or instances (as opposed to nut events which can have multiple instances).
    - This should synchronize with Healthkit occasionally, probably just upon application reactivation (since the user will have used some other app for the workout).
    - I don't think it is possible for this app to delete a workout event. 
    - AFAIK, none of these events would be sent to the Tidepool service. If they are synced with other devices, that would happen because the applications generating these events are doing that.
    - Some higher level function will be needed to return a sorted and searched list of NutEvent and WorkoutEvent items, which is what we actually need to display.
